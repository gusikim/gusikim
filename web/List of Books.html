            <P> Pretending as her cruel stepsister, Ace Zaldua graced the Mercadejas mansion with confidence and grit. Ang tanging gusto niya lang roon ay ang makuha ang pera para matustusan niya na ang pag-aaral at mamuhay na siya ng payapa, malayo sa kanyang stepmpther at stepsister.Wala siyang pakialam kung marami man siyang malokong mga tao. Wala siyang pakialam kung ginagamat lang siya ni Daniella, ang kanyang nagrerebeldeng stepsister, para lang makatakas sa isang arranged marriage. Daniella ran away with her boyfriend while her mother believed that she went to the Mercadejas mansion to meet her supposedly fiance.Nasilaw sa pera at sa kagustuhang makatapos sa pag-aaral nang walang aberya, binalewala niya ang unti-unting nararamdaman para kay Zamiel Mercadejas.

Bagama’t siya ay mulat na ang nakaugalian ay pawang kasinungalingan lamang, walang magawa dahil sa kabataan at kahirapan sa buhay.She was almost convinced that her dreams will forever remain dreams until one day, she noticed how everything was slowly becoming a reality – she started going to school, she has friends, and she was noticed by Raoul Riego. It isn’t easy to be in love with the most respected, beautiful, and richest young man of Costa Leona; more so when their worlds are opposite apart.She thought she was a step closer to her dreams of going to college, having a career, and having a normal life.
